# [Google Search Timeline](https://niutech.github.io/google-search-timeline/)

Do you remember [Google News Timeline](https://news.googleblog.com/2009/04/introducing-google-news-timeline.html) from 2009? It presented Google News search results in a multi-column layout, grouped by time periods. Unfortunately, it was shut down in 2011. I have recreated it using the cutting-edge [AMP HTML](https://www.ampproject.org/) technology and combine multiple Google Search results: web, images, videos and news, grouped by months, quarters and years. It also provides Google Trends graph for your search query. This is useful for monitoring popularity of brands, people, companies across time. Google Search Timeline is best viewed on desktop.
